# TimeChain: Timestamp Authentication System for Digital Media

## Project Description  
TimeChain is a blockchain-based system that enables creators and owners of digital media to register cryptographic hashes of their media onto a public ledger. By anchoring a timestamp and registrant address on-chain, TimeChain provides verifiable proof of existence, ownership and time of creation for digital assets.

## Project Vision  
In a world where digital media can be copied or manipulated easily, TimeChain aims to offer a decentralized and immutable way to prove authenticity and provenance of digital content. Whether you're a photographer, filmmaker, digital artist, or content creator â€” you gain trusted evidence that your work existed at a certain moment and that you registered it.

## Key Features  
- Register a media hash (e.g., SHA-256 or IPFS content identifier) with a blockchain timestamp.  
- Verify any registered media hash to retrieve the original registrant and timestamp.  
- Optionally update or link a new proof/hash to an existing record (maintaining the original timestamp) if additional evidence emerges.  
- Transparent and immutable record of media registrations on-chain.

## Future Scope  
- Support batch registrations (register many media items in one transaction).  
- Integrate with IPFS or other decentralized storage to link entire media files, not just hashes.  
- Provide a front-end dApp for creators to manage and view their registrations.  
- Implement ownership transfer or licensing workflows (e.g., transfer registrant rights).  
- Add an event log for off-chain indexing and searchability of registered media.  
- Explore zero-knowledge proof integration for privacy-preserving registrations.
